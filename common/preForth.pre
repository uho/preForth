\
\ and 
\    - no immediate words, i.e.
\    - no control structures IF ELSE THEN BEGIN WHILE REPEAT UNTIL
\    - no defining words
\    - no DOES>
\    - no memory @ ! CMOVE ALLOT ,
\    - no pictured numeric output
\    - no input stream

\    - no CATCH and THROW
\    - no error handling

\ Prerequisites:
\ Just 13 primitives: emit key dup swap drop 0< ?exit >r r> - nest unnest lit


\ ---------------------------------------------------
\ Words required from backend:
\
\ primitives: 
\    emit key dup swap drop 0< ?exit >r r> - nest unnest lit
\
\ compiler words:
\   ,line ,comment ,codefield ,end
\   ,lit ,word ,nest ,unnest ,tail
\
\ header creation:
\   header label bodylabel
\
\ Words defined in runtime system
\   ?dup 0= negate + 1+ 1- = < > case? over rot nip 2drop pick roll
\   bl space tab cr u. .
\   show _dup _drop _swap 

\ -----------
\ parse input
\ -----------
\ Input has only key. Ascii End of Transmission, 4, Ctrl-D signals end of input.
\ We scan input on a character by character basis skiping whitespace (control characters) and collecting non control characters
\ essentially extracting tokens a word boundaries.

\ This all leads to the word  token  that gets the next word from the input.
\ As preForth word names can contain symbol characters and the assembler can most likely not handle symbols in labels,
\ a simple subsitution is defined that replaces symbols to upper case letters. Because of this all preForth definitions themselves
\ are assumed to have lower case letters only to avoid name clashes.

\ skip reads and ignores control character and returns the next non-control character (or EOF when the input is exhausted).
: skip ( -- c )
    key dup bl > ?exit
    dup 4 = ?exit \ eof
    drop   tail skip ;

\ scan reads and appends non-control characters to the given string. Returns resulting string and the delimiting character.
: scan ( S1 -- S2 bl )
    key dup bl > 0= ?exit swap 1+ scan ;

: (line ( S1 -- S2 )
    key swap 1+ over 10 = ?exit   tail (line ;

\ line reads the rest of the current line and returns it as a string.
: line ( -- S )
    0 (line ;

\ token gets the next whitespace separated token from the input and returns it as topmost string on the stack.
: token ( -- S )
    skip  1 scan drop ;


\ -----------------
\ Code definitions
\ -----------------
\ preForth uses code definitions in the form
\
\ code <name> ( stack comment )
\     assembly instruction
\     ...
\     assembly instruction
\ ;
\
\ To define primitives.
\ The assembly instructions are copied verbatim to the output. No processing takes place.
\ Note, that the assembly instructions start at the line after code. All characters
\ following <name> on the same line are ignored.
\ As preForth has no immediate words, comments must be handled by code directly.
\ ; has to be placed on a line of its own to be recognized.

\ Code definitions and also the :-compiler and interpreter use a scheme of handlers trying to process
\ the current line (or token) as topmost string. The first handler that can process the string, performs
\ its action (possibly leaving items beneath the string) and turns the string into an empty string.
\
\ Code works on lines of source code.

\ handle ;

\ ?: detects a single ; character 
: ?; ( S --  0 | S )
   dup 0= ?exit
   dup 1 - ?exit
   over ';' - ?exit
   _drop 0 ;

\ detect if there is a ; as single character in a line 
: ?;< ( S -- tf | S ff )
    dup 2 - ?exit
    2 pick ';' - ?exit
    over 10 - ?exit
    _drop 0 ; 

\ pre just copies the following line verbatim to output until a single ; on a line of its own is detected.
: pre ( -- )
    line  ?;< ?dup 0= ?exit ,line   tail pre ;

\ code starts a code definition. Lines are replicated to output until a single ; on a line of its own is detected.
: code ( <name> -- )

    _dup ,comment
    \ 0 header
    ,code  line _drop  pre  ,end-code ;
    
\ Colon definitions - the preForth compiler
\ -----------------------------------------
\ preForth uses :-definitions in the form
\
\ : <name> ( stack comment )
\     word 99 'x' \ comment
\     ...
\     word word word ;
\
\ To define secondary (threaded code) words. The body of the :-definition is compiled by the appropriate
\ compiler handlers. 
\ Note, that as for code definitions, the body starts at the line after : <name> and comment. All characters
\ following <name> on the same line are ignored.
\
\ In preForth : does not switch to compiler mode but contains a loop on its own, traditionally called ] .
\ It uses the same handler scheme as code definitions and the interpreter.
\ 
\ The :-compiler works on tokens.


\ compiler handlers
\ =================

\ handle character literals
\ -------------------------

\ ?'x' detects and compiles a character literal.
: ?'x' ( S -- 0 | S )
       dup 0= ?exit
       dup 3 - ?exit
       over   ''' - ?exit
       3 pick ''' - ?exit
       2 pick >r _drop r>
       ,lit 0 ;

\ handle numbers
\ --------------
\ preForth can compile signed and unsigned decimal numbers.
\ Digit sequences are detected by ?# and compiled by ?lit as a lit primtive followed by the number.
\ Note, that the compiler could in principle just copy the number token to the output.
\ The interpreter however needs to put the numbers on the stack, so the conversion is
\ still necessary there.
\ preForth has no base and processed decimal numbers only.

\ digit checks whether a given character is a decimal digit.
: ?digit ( c -- x 0 | c )
    dup '0' < ?exit  '9' over < ?exit '0' - 0 ;

\ ?'-' checks if the first character of the topmost string is a '-' sign.
: ?'-' ( S -- flag )
    dup pick >r dup >r  _drop r> 1 > r> '-' = ?exit drop 0 ;

: ((?# ( S x1 -- 0 x2 ff | ci ... cn n-i x2 tf )
      over dup 0= ?exit drop
      >r dup pick r> swap ?digit ?dup ?exit
      swap 10* + >r  dup roll drop 1- r>    tail ((?# ;

: (?# ( S x1 -- tf | x ff )
      ((?# >r >r _drop r> r> dup 0= ?exit nip ;

 : ?-# ( S -- ci ... cn n-i tf | x ff )
     _dup ?'-' 0= dup ?exit drop   \ check for leading '-'
     dup roll drop 1-              \ remove leading '-'
     0 (?# ?dup ?exit
     negate 0 ;

: ?+-#  ( S -- tf | x ff )
     ?-# dup 0= ?exit drop     \ try to convert negative
     0 (?# ;                   \ try to convert positive

\ ?# detects and handles a signed or unsigned decimal number and puts its value on the stack.
: ?#  ( S -- x ff | S )
    dup 0= ?exit
    _dup ?+-# ?exit >r _drop r> 0 ;    

\ ?lit detects and handles a signed or unsigned decimal number and compiles it.
: ?lit  ( S -- ff | S )
    dup 0= ?exit
    _dup ?+-# ?exit >r _drop r> ,lit 0 ;    

\ Handle comments
\ ---------------

\ ?\ detects and handles \ comments by ignoring the rest of the current input line.
: ?\ ( S -- 0 | S )
   dup 1 -    ?exit  \ length 
   over '\' - ?exit  \ sole character
   _drop line _drop 0 ; \ skip rest of line


\ Handle tail calls

: ?tail ( S -- 0 | S )
   dup 4 -      ?exit
   4 pick 't' - ?exit 
   3 pick 'a' - ?exit
   2 pick 'i' - ?exit
   over   'l' - ?exit
   _drop  token ,tail  0 ;

\ Handle words
\ ------------

\ ?word detects and handles words by compiling them as reference.
: ?word ( S -- 0 | S )
     dup 0= ?exit ,word 0 ;

\ Compiler loop
\ -------------

: ] ( -- )
    token             \ get next token
    \ run compilers
    ?; ?dup 0= ?exit  \ ;  leave compiler loop
    ?\                \ comment
    ?tail
    ?'x'              \ character literal
    ?lit              \ number
    ?word             \ word
    _drop  tail ] ;   \ ignore unhandled token and cycle
    
\ (:  creates label for word and compiles body.
: (:  ( S  -- )
    _dup label   line _drop  ,nest  bodylabel  ]   ,unnest ;

\ :' is the pre: that already has the intended :-functionality. However : has to be defined as last word. See below.
: :' ( <name> -- )
    token
    _dup ,comment
    \ 0 header
    (: ;

\ -----------
\ Interpreter
\ -----------
\ As preForth has no dictionary the interpreter must detect the words to execute on its own.
\ The preForth interpreter handles
\    - Code definitions
\    - :-definitions
\    - signed and unsigned decimal numbers.
\    - \-comments

\ interpreter handlers
\ ---------------------

\ ?: detects a single : token and executes the :-compiler.
: ?: ( S c -- 0 | S )
   dup 0= ?exit
   dup 1 - ?exit
   over ':' - ?exit
   _drop :' 0 ;

\ ?code detects the code token and executes the inline assembler.
: ?code ( S -- 0 | S )
   dup 4 - ?exit
   4 pick 'c' - ?exit
   3 pick 'o' - ?exit
   2 pick 'd' - ?exit
   over   'e' - ?exit
   _drop code 0 ;

\ ?pre detects token starting with pre and copies lines verbatim.
: ?pre ( S -- 0 | S )
    dup 3 < ?exit
    dup pick     'p' - ?exit
    dup 1 - pick 'r' - ?exit
    dup 2 - pick 'e' - ?exit
    _drop pre 0 ;

\ quit is the top level preForth interpreter loop. It reads tokens and handles them until
\ an error occurs or the input is exhausted.
: quit ( -- )
    token   \ get next token
    \ run interpreters
    ?:              \ :-definition
    ?code           \ code definitions
    ?pre            \ pre* 
    ?\              \ comment
    dup ?exit drop  \ unhandled or EOF
    tail quit ;          \ cycle

\ cold initializes the dictionary link and starts the interpreter. Acknowledge end on exit.
: cold ( -- )
    \ '0' 1        \ dictionary anchor
    quit \ _drop   \ eof
    \ top of dictionary as string on stack
    ,end ;
